# Q & A

Q: How does it works ?

A: This tweak does NOT contains or edit any part of the original 1.8 Damage Indicators. It just adds another constuctor to ScaledResolutions to fix compat.

Q: Why not use Toro Health / other mods on 1.8.9 ?

A: Other same func mods are not perfect. Toro Health refreshes too slow for PVP. I believe DI is still useful on 1.8.9.

Q: There's a render bug with some blocks!

A: That's a native DI 1.8's bug. Use DI's minimal skin instead of default to avoid it.
