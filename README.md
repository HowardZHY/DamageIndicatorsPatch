# DamageIndicatorsPatch

Made Damage Indicators 1.8-3.3.3 compatible with MC 1.8.9.

# Guide
1. Download DamageIndicators[1.8]v3.3.3 from original minecraftforum post [https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1286538-hit-splat-damage-indicators-v3-3-2-rpg-ui-and]
2. Just put this and DI 1.8-3.3.3 in mods folder and you'll found DI works fine again with PVP!

## Q & A

Q: How does it works ?

A: This tweak doesn't contains or edit any part of the original 1.8 Damage Indicators. It just adds another constuctor to ScaledResolutions to fix compat.

Q: Why not use Toro Health / other mods on 1.8.9 ?

A: Other same func mods are not perfect. Toro Health refreshes too slow for PVP. I believe DI is still useful on 1.8.9.
